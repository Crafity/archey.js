## Credits

Based on Archey by Melik Manukyan and screenfetch by Brett Bohnenkamper. The Archey and screenfetch credits mention the following people, so I want to acknowledge them here as well:

- ASCII art by Brett Bohnenkamper
- Changes by Jerome Launay
- Fedora support by YeOK
- OS X proting by shrx and Hu6

I figured I'd better not include their email addresses here given that this is a separate project.
